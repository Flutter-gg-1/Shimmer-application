# Flutter Shimmer and Image Transition Example

This Flutter project demonstrates the use of shimmer animation to transition from gradient containers to images after a delay.

## Features

- **Shimmer Animation**: Initially, gradient containers and circles are displayed with a shimmer effect.
- **Image Transition**: After a delay of 5 seconds, the shimmer effect stops, and the gradient containers and circles are replaced by images.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **lib/**: Contains all the Dart files.
  - **main.dart**: Entry point of the application.
  - **gradient_widgets.dart**: Defines widgets for gradient containers and circles.
  - **image_widgets.dart**: Defines widgets for displaying images within containers and circles.
  - **src/**: Contains custom painter files.
    - **rps_custom_painter.dart**: Defines a custom painter for drawing a specific path used in the background.
